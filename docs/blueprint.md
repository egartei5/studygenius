## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#3F51B5) to evoke feelings of intellect, focus, and trustworthiness. This color provides a solid, calming foundation for the learning environment.
- Background color: Very light grey (#F0F2F5), a near-white color of the same hue as indigo. Its lightness provides excellent contrast, as called for by a light color scheme.
- Accent color: Violet (#9C27B0). Positioned on the color wheel near indigo, this contrast color adds depth and visual interest, for interactive elements or key content sections.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif. The computerized, techy, scientific look is very appropriate for this app focused on learning, and will only be used for headlines or short labels.
- Body font: 'Inter' sans-serif. Its modern, neutral look works great in conjunction with 'Space Grotesk'; long lines of text will not be an issue for readability.
- Use simple, outlined icons from a consistent set for clear visual communication. The icons should relate to actions such as generating, saving, and sharing.
- Employ a clean, card-based layout to organize study materials. Cards will use rounded corners, and be well-spaced to prevent content from feeling cluttered.
